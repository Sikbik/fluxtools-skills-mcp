# `/ioutils/*` — File Upload

This category currently contains a single upload helper:

- `POST /ioutils/fileupload/<type?>/<appname?>/<component?>/<folder?>/<filename?>`

It is typically used by UI workflows to upload files into app storage.

See the full list in `references/endpoints-inventory.md` (category: `ioutils`).
